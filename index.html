              <h3>Interesting facts and news</h3>
              <p>Australia officially the Commonwealth of Australia,
                is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the
                Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous
                smaller islands. It is the largest country in Oceania and
                the world's sixth-largest country by total area.
                The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia
                and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu
                to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east.
                Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest city
                is Sydney.</p>

              <p>For about 60,000 years before the first British settlement in the
                late 18th
                century, Australia was inhabited by indigenous Australians, who
                in documented times have spoken languages classifiable into roughly
                250 groups. After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch
                explorers in 1606, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great
                Britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation
                to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788. The population
                grew steadily in subsequent decades, and by the 1850s most of the
                continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing
                crown colonies established. On 1 January 1901, the six colonies
                federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. Australia has
                since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that
                functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy comprising
                six states and several territories.</p>

                <p>Sia Kate Isobelle Furler is an Australian singer-songwriter,
                  record producer and music video director. She started
                  her career as a singer in the acid jazz band Crisp
                  in the mid-1990s in Adelaide. In 1997, when Crisp
                  disbanded, she released her debut studio album titled
                  OnlySee in Australia. She moved to London, England,
                  and provided lead vocals for the British duo Zero 7.</p>

                <p>Although most of Australia is semi-arid or desert,
                  it includes a diverse range of habitats from alpine
                  heaths to tropical rainforests, and is recognised as
                  a megadiverse country. Fungi typify that diversity;
                  an estimated 250,000 species—of which only 5% have
                  been described—occur in Australia. Because of the
                  continent's great age, extremely variable weather
                  patterns, and long-term geographic isolation, much of
                  Australia's biota is unique. About 85% of flowering plants,
                  84% of mammals, more than 45% of birds, and 89% of in-shore,
                  temperate-zone fish are endemic. Australia has the
                  greatest number of reptiles of any country, with 755 species.
                  Besides Antarctica, Australia is the only continent that
                  developed without feline species. Feral cats may have been
                  introduced in the 17th century by Dutch shipwrecks, and later
                  in the 18th century by European settlers. They are now
                  considered a major factor in the decline and extinction
                  of many vulnerable and endangered native species.</p>

                <p>The climate of Australia is significantly influenced by ocean currents, including the Indian Ocean Dipole and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, which is correlated with periodic drought, and the seasonal tropical low-pressure system that produces cyclones in northern Australia.[117][118] These factors cause rainfall to vary markedly from year to year. Much of the northern part of the country has a tropical, predominantly summer-rainfall (monsoon).[98] The south-west corner of the country has a Mediterranean climate.[119] The south-east ranges from oceanic (Tasmania and coastal Victoria) to humid subtropical (upper half of New South Wales). The interior is arid to semi-arid.
                According to the Bureau of Meteorology's 2011 Australian Climate Statement, Australia had lower than average temperatures in 2011 as a consequence of a La Niña weather pattern; however, "the country's 10-year average continues to demonstrate the rising trend in temperatures, with 2002–2011 likely to rank in the top two warmest 10-year periods on record for Australia, at 0.52 °C (0.94 °F) above the long-term average".[120] Furthermore, 2014 was Australia's third warmest year since national temperature observations commenced in 1910.
